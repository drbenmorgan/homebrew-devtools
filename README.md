homebrew-devtools
=================

Homebrew formulae for LBNE development tools. Tested on Macbrew only,
bu intended to also work with Linuxbrew.

To use this tap, first [install Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew), then add the tap:

```sh
$ brew tap drbenmorgan/devtools
```

At present there is only one Formula, [FNALCore](https://github.com/LBNE/FNALCore), which can be install like other Formulae:

```
$ brew install fnalcore
```

This tap will be updated as packages develop, and should be considered
unstable at present.
