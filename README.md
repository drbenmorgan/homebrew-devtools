homebrew-devtools
=================

Homebrew formulae for DUNE software. Tested on Macbrew only, but intended to also work with Linuxbrew.

To use this tap, first [install Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew) for Mac, or [install Linuxbrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/linuxbrew), then add the tap:

```sh
$ brew tap drbenmorgan/dune
```

At present there is only one Formula, [FNALCore](https://github.com/LBNE/FNALCore), which can be installed like other Formulae:

```
$ brew install fnalcore
```

This tap will be updated as packages develop, and should be considered
unstable at present.
